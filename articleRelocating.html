                <p>This information was extracted from one of my conversations with a reknowned immigration consultant, based in Ortario, Canada whom i wish you could get to meet.</p>
                <h1>THE SUREST WAY TO BECOME A CANADIAN PERMANENT RESIDENT:</h1>
                <p>As we write this post, the only people allowed into Canada are those with work permit or study permit.</p>
                <p>Previously, you could get into Canada through the express entry (as a skilled worker), Provincial nominee program (get nominated by a province), the Egricultural pilot, home care pilot which requires you have a job in Canada or certain years of experience before you can get your Visa approved. To be objective, getting a job in Canada from outside Canada is very difficult, there are tons of people in Canada looking for job in Canada, how much more those outside Canada.</p>
                <p>for the express entry, you're required to have a minimum CRS score of 490 which is very high, I must say (click <a href="#">here</a> to check how the CRS score is calculated).</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, most of these routes have been restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But good news, some of these routes are still very much active and we'll be giving you updates as to when these routes start again.</p>
                <p>Join our community to get the latest verified  updates on immigration policies and available routes to Canada this 2023.</p>
                <p>Thus, the study route is the fastest and surest way at the moment. Become a student, get a post-graduation work permit and apply for permanent residence.</p>
                <p>CAN YOU REALLY GET TO CANADA IN 3-6 MONTHS AS THE AGENT PROMISED?</p>
                <p>3 months? Absolutely unrealistic! 6-9 months? Definitely!</p>
                <p>Why? the postgraduate admission in Canada usually starts September. All schools start September but some schools have winter (January) openings.</p>
                <p>WHY YOU DON'T EVEN NEED IELTS:</p>
                <p>Most schools (Universities and Colleges) do not request for English proficiency test from Nigerians, as English is our language of learning. However, some schools still ask, if this is your case, all you need is write a letter to the school informing them that you have studied in English and you would like a waiver, and you won't be needing an IELTS exam. (click <a href="#">here</a> to discover the proven study strategy to a band 8.0 IELTS score).</p>
                <p>3 MISTAKES THAT MAY COST YOU YOUR CANADIAN VISA:</p>
                <p>Each country are completely different, Canada for instance;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <dfn>
                            <dt>IGNORANCE:</dt>
                            <dd>People rush into application without understanding exactly what the visa officer is actually looking for. 
                                <br> If you've been denied visa before, stop this instance and listen! Study your previous applications, there's something
                                the visa officer isn't comfortable with, and if possible, get a GCSR (can be gotten through anyone in Canada), this is
                                where the visa officer will state what exactly he isn't comfortable with in your application and you'll be able to
                                rectify and write a letter stating you've rectified. <br> If you rush to apply again, all the visa officer has to do is check your record, and upon seeing that you've been rekjected before, check for the fault, and if he sees the same fault again, boom... rejected!
                            </dd>
                        </dfn>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dfn>
                            <dt>FINANCES/FUNDING:</dt>
                            <dd>They do not have enough money, do not know how to effectively apply for funding and Scholarship or use comanies, non-related relatives, and so on as sponsors. if you want to use any of those, write an highly convincing emaail stating reasonable reasons why sponsorship is needed. This most times requires skills and experience in the field, there are templates that could also be fine-tuned.</dd>

                            <dt>SOP AND OTHER VITAL EMAILS:</dt>
                            <dd>

                “I am very happy to see that the deal has been made. I am very
                grateful to the owners of the Chelsea FC for their support. I have

                understood to represent a major expression of faith in the prospective

                Todd Boehly is set to be named as Chelsea's controlling owner once the
                American-Swiss consortium's takeover is complete. This comes after the
                group signed an agreement to take over from Roman Abramovich and have
                now been submitted for approval from the Premier League and UK
                Government.

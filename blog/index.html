        <div class="article__text">
          <p>
            Chelsea confirmed on Saturday that a consortium led by LA Dodgers
            co-owner Todd Boehly has won the battle to buy the Premier League
            club in a £4.25 billion ($5.2 billion) deal. Owner Roman Abramovich
            put Chelsea on the market in early March, just days before he was
            sanctioned by the British government following Russia’s invasion of
            Ukraine.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a lengthy bidding process involving several groups, Boehly and
            his fellow investors were picked by Raine Group, the New York bank
            overseeing the sale.Boehly’s consortium includes a fellow co-owner
            of the Dodgers baseball franchise, Mark Walter, Swiss billionaire
            Hansjoerg Wyss and US investment firm Clearlake Capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Chelsea Football Club can confirm that terms have been agreed for a
            new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark
            Walter, and Hansjoerg Wyss, to acquire the club,” they said in a
            statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of the total investment being made, £2.5 billion will be applied to
            purchase the shares in the club, and such proceeds will be deposited
            into a frozen UK bank account with the intention to donate 100
            percent to charitable causes as confirmed by Roman Abramovich.“UK
            government approval will be required for the proceeds to be
            transferred from the frozen UK bank account.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the new owners will commit £1.75 billion in further
            investment “for the benefit of the club”, Chelsea said. The total
            value of the deal smashes the previous record for the sale of a
            sports team — $2.4 billion for the New York Mets baseball franchise
            in 2020. Chelsea’s 42,000-capacity Stamford Bridge home is in need
            of major redevelopment to match the stadium size and income streams
            enjoyed by their rivals.
          </p>

          <p>
            But Boehly has a track record of delivering both stadium improvement
            and sporting success with the Dodgers.Thanks to heavy investment in
            players, the Dodgers have made the MLB (Major League Baseball)
            playoffs every season for the past nine years and won their first
            World Series for 32 years in 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            Boehly’s consortium still needs to satisfy the Premier League’s
            owners’ and directors’ test, but Chelsea said they expect the sale
            to be completed by the end of the month.Boehly is expected to attend
            the Premier League clash with Wolves at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust said it welcomed the club’s
            announcement. “We will continue to hold close discussions with the
            prospective owners,” it said in a statement. “We are optimistic
            about the future of #CFC. We hope that the sale is completed
            swiftly.”

          Todd Boehly is set to be named as Chelsea's controlling owner once the
          American-Swiss consortium's takeover is complete. This comes after the
          group signed an agreement to take over from Roman Abramovich and have
          now been submitted for approval from the Premier League and UK
          Government.

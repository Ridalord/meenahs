                <p><b>From Surulere to Canada in 9 months; the hidden japa recipe.</b></p>
                <p>In response to the several mails I've been receiving since last April requesting that I make a post about relocating to Canada. I wasn't sure I had enough verified information.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, during the New Year festive, I met Sammy bob at my cousin's naming ceremony; he's a friend of Daniel (my brother-in-law). Samuel is short for Samuel Olabisi, I learned he moved to Canada with his wife and three kids 2 years ago. Remembering the tons of emails I've received, I invited him over for dinner.</p>
                <p>We talked about Nigeria, the economic meltdown and non-functional system, and how relocating was the best decision he made for himself and his family. I expressed my fears and insecurities about the agencies and how a travel agent duped my friend of ₦750,000.</p>
                <p>He then said and I quote <q>There are ways to do things and not just doing, but doing it right! And to do it right, you learn it right! In other words, FOLLOW WHO KNOW ROAD!!</q>.</p>
                <p>He had then been introduced to a relocation guide book that will help him step by step through the process, but he wasn't ready to spend ₦40,000 on an E-book. He felt it was just a book, a soft-copy at that.</p>
                <p>I also learned that night that Sammy had also lost about ₦500,000 to an agent (scam) <br> Let's not talk about the three failed attempts at IELTS.</p>
                <p>He then decided to give the book a try, 40k was nothing compared to what he had lost.</p>
                <p>In his words: <q>Looking back now, doubting that guide was probably the most foolish thought I had that year. What I needede then was just one proven method, follow it to the letter and I would have gotten out of here sooner and richer</q>.</p>
                <p>Imagine all you had to spend was 40k on a guide to help you through, and you'll never have to loose 6 digits or go through the emotional and physical stress he went through.</p>
                <p>This step by step guide that took 43 years old Mr. Sammy by the hand and relocated him and his family to Canada from Surulere in 2022, without IELTS was written by Oluseyi Obasi, a Canadian resident.</p>
                <p>He's willing to take you by the hand and guide you all the way through:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Relocate to Canada in 9-12 months,</li>
                    <li>AT ANY AGE</li>
                    <li>Withouth the hassel of IELTS and</li>
                    <li>Without loosing money in the process</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Thankfully, it was'nt late for Sammy, but he wished he had acted earlier, he wouldn't have lost that ₦500,000.</p>

                “I am very happy to see that the deal has been made. I am very
                grateful to the owners of the Chelsea FC for their support. I have
                confidence in Boehly taking the controlling ownership role is
                understood to represent a major expression of faith in the prospective
                new Chelsea owner’s judgement.”

                Todd Boehly is set to be named as Chelsea's controlling owner once the
                American-Swiss consortium's takeover is complete. This comes after the
                group signed an agreement to take over from Roman Abramovich and have
                now been submitted for approval from the Premier League and UK
                Government.
